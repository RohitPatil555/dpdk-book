# DPDK Training

I will try to cover DPDK from basic to advance with example code.
And also explain about DPDK internal to understand it in detail.

To gain more, you must practice example by running them.

I am using ubuntu 20.04 OS and current DPDK stable release version v20.11.

apt install build-essential
apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install meson ninja

Please refer to [DPDK document](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/linux_gsg/sys_reqs.html#compilation-of-the-dpdk)
